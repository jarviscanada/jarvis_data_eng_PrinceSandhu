# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent

# Introduction
The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent enables users to monitor the individual Linux hosts/nodes of a system which have been connected internally via a switch.
The individual nodes initially provide hardware specifications (architecture, model, speed, memory, etc.) and, with the use of `crontab`, periodically provide usage data (available memory, kernel usage, disk I/O, etc.), including whether a node has failed (if it provides less than three updates in a five-minute interval). This aforementioned information can aid the LCA team make informed decisions about the system in question.

Technologies utilized:
- Docker
- Bash
- Postgres SQL

# Quick Start
````
#Create and start the PSQL instance (provisioned using Docker).
./scripts/psql_docker.sh create postgres password
./scripts/psql_docker.sh start

#Create appropriate tables using ddl.sql.
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d host_agent -f sql/ddl.sql

#Insert hardware specifications data into the database using host_info.sh.
./scripts/host_info.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password

#Insert hardware usage data into the database using host_usage.sh.
./scripts/host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password

#Crontab setup (host_usage executes every minute).
* * * * * bash /pwd/scripts/host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_usage postgres password > /tmp/host_usage.log
````
# Implementation
The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent project has been provisioned using Docker through the `psql_docker.sh` script. Each host/node contains `host_info.sh` and `host_usage.sh`. The former script records the hardware specification and the latter records the resource usage data of their respective hosts. Resource usage data is collected every minute, which is configured with `crontab`. The scripts record the aforementioned data into the `host_info` and `host_usage` tables of the `host_agent` PostgreSQL database. SQL queries are constructed to group hosts by hardware info, average memory usage, and to detect host failure.

## Scripts
The following contains a high-level description of each script and its usage.

- `psql_docker.sh`
  - Provisions PSQL instance using Docker.
  - Starts/stops the Docker container containing the PSQL instance.
````
./scripts/psql_docker.sh create db_username db_password
./scripts/psql_docker.sh start | stop
````

- `host_info.sh`
  - Collects host hardware specification data and inserts it into the `host_info` table of the `host_agent` database.
````
./scripts/host_info.sh HOST_NAME PSQL_PORT db_name db_username db_password
````

- `host_usage.sh`
  - Collects host usage data and inserts it into the `host_usage` table of the `host_agent` database.
````
./scripts/host_usage.sh HOST_NAME PSQL_PORT db_name db_username db_password
````

- `crontab`
  - Edit the `crontab` info to execute the `host_usage.sh` script every minute.
````
* * * * * bash [path to host_usage.sh] HOST_NAME PSQL_PORT db_name db_username db_password > /tmp/host_usage.log
````

- `queries.sql`
  - Query 1: Groups host by CPU number and sort by their memory size in descending order. 
  - Query 2: Calculates the percentage of the average memory used over a five minute interval for each host.
  - Query 3: Detects host failure. If updated less than three times in a period of five minutes, the host has failed.

## Database Modeling
The following contains the schema for the `host_info` and `host_usage` tables.

# Deployment
- The PostgreSQL database has been provisioned using Docker.
- The `host_info.sh` script is initially run to records the hardware specification into the database.
- With the help of `crontab`, the `host_usage.sh` script runs periodically (every minute) and records the usage data into the database.
- All corresponding scripts have been stored on GitHub.

# Improvements
1. Create a Bash script to detect any hardware changes and update the `host_info` table accordingly. Would be significantly more convenient for long-term application use.
2. Include more columna (power usage, temperature, etc.) in the `host_usage` table. Would greatly benefit the LCA team in making informed decisions about the system.
3. Include a script to run all commands at once.
