# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering from McMaster University in 2019. I am currently employed by Jarvis Consulting Group in pursuit of extensively expanding my software application skills through working on various exciting projects by utilizing current and in-demand technologies and frameworks. My prior industry experience includes a one-year internship at the Ontario Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. I supported the System Development & Maintenance team in planning, developing, implementing, and testing the Child Protection Information Network (CPIN) application, along with providing tier-2 support for onboarding regional agencies. I particularly enjoy tackling new challenges regularly and the dynamic nature of the profession is what excites me and is precisely the reason why I chose to pursue a career in the software development industry.
